# LearnHere
A website inspired from coursera. For Front end, HTML, CSS and JavaScript is used. PHP is used for backend.

The project is authentic and I am determined to work further to extend my project. I have used my own teacher's pictures 
so I am extremly sorry about not giving the images. But you can use the code and I hope it helps.
